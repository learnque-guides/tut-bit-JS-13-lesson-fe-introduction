# Traversing

Let's play around with traversing. Traversing a data structure means: "visiting" or "touching" the elements of the structure, and doing something with the data. (Traversing is also sometimes called iterating over the data structure).

We will use *filter*, *map*, *reduce*, *forEach*, *some*, *every* :)
